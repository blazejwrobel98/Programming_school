# Rebase vs Merge in Git

## Description
In team-based work using Git, a common question is when to use `rebase` and when to use `merge`. Both methods are used to integrate changes from one branch into another, but they do so in different ways. This document aims to explain the differences between them and when to use each method.

## Rebase
`Rebase` involves moving or "rewriting" a sequence of changes from one branch onto another.

### Advantages
- Creates a linear history of changes, making it easier to track and understand the project's history.
- Avoids creating additional merge commits.

### Disadvantages
- Can cause issues in public history if not used cautiously.
- May be confusing for those not well-versed in Git.

## Merge
`Merge` combines two branches by creating a new commit that includes changes from both branches.

### Advantages
- Preserves the full history and context of changes.
- Safer for public and shared branches.

### Disadvantages
- Can create a complicated history due to merge commits.
- Sometimes more difficult to resolve conflicts.

## When to Use
- **Rebase**: For local cleanups and a clean history before merging into a public branch.
- **Merge**: When merging public branches or wanting to preserve the full history of changes.

## Conclusion
The choice between `rebase` and `merge` should be dictated by the specific situation and team preferences. It is important to understand the consequences of each method and apply them appropriately to the context of the work.
