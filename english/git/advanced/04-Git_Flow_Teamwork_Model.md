# Git Flow - Teamwork Model

## Description
Git Flow is a popular model of teamwork in Git, designed to facilitate the management of large projects. This document will discuss the main aspects of Git Flow and how to apply them.

## Git Flow Basics
Git Flow uses fixed branches and naming conventions to simplify work organization and collaboration in a team.

### Main Branches
- **master**: The main branch containing the production code.
- **develop**: The development branch where ongoing work takes place.

### Support for Different Types of Work
- **feature branches**: Branches for new features, branched off from `develop`.
- **release branches**: Branches for preparing releases, allowing for final fixes and preparation for merging with `master`.
- **hotfix branches**: Branches for urgent fixes directly on `master`.

## Work Process
1. **Starting Work on a Feature**: Creating a `feature` branch from `develop`.
2. **Completing a Feature**: Merging the `feature` branch back into `develop`.
3. **Preparing a Release**: Creating a `release` branch from `develop` and finalizing changes.
4. **Release**: Merging the `release` branch with `master` and `develop`.
5. **Fixes**: Creating a `hotfix` branch directly from `master` and merging back into `master` and `develop`.

## Conclusion
Git Flow is an effective work model that provides clear guidelines for managing different stages of project development. It helps maintain order, especially in larger teams and complex projects.
