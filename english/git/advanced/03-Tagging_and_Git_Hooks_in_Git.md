## Description
Tagging and Git Hooks are advanced features in Git that enhance project management and task automation. This document discusses how to utilize these features in practice.

## Tagging in Git
Tags in Git are used to mark significant points in a project's history, such as releases or major changes.

### Creating Tags
- **Lightweight Tags**: Quick way to mark a commit.
  ```
  git tag tag_name
  ```
- **Annotated Tags**: Include additional information like author, date, and message.
  ```
  git tag -a tag_name -m "message"
  ```

### Using Tags
- Utilize tags to identify release versions.
- Navigate to specific tags in project history.

## Git Hooks
Git Hooks are scripts executed automatically at certain actions in Git, such as commit, push, or merge.

### Types of Git Hooks
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run before a commit is finalized.
- **Post-commit Hooks**: Run after a commit is finalized.
- **Pre-push Hooks**: Run before changes are pushed to a remote repository.

### Examples of Use
- Automatic code style checks before a commit.
- Running tests before a push.

## Conclusion
Tagging and Git Hooks are powerful tools that can significantly contribute to improved organization and efficiency in project management. They allow for better version control and the automation of routine tasks related to code management.
