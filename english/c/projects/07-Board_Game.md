# Board Game

## Description
The aim of this project is to create a simple board game in C that operates in a console environment. The game should offer interactive gameplay for one or more players.

## Project Assumptions
- The game operates in text mode (console).
- Possibility of single-player or multiplayer gameplay.
- The game includes typical board game rules such as movements on the board, performing tasks, or earning points.

## Functionality
1. **Game Interface**: Creation of an interactive user interface in the console.
2. **Game Mechanics**: Implementation of game rules, including character movements, point scoring, etc.
3. **Board Visualization**: Visual representation of the game board in the console.
4. **Gameplay**: Handling of players' turns and managing the state of the game.

## Implementation Tips
- Use conditional statements and loops to implement the game logic.
- Consider using structures to manage the game state and characters.
- Implement a simple text interface for user interaction.

## Educational Goal
This project allows for practical application of basic C programming techniques in the context of creating an interactive game. It serves as an excellent exercise in programming logic, input/output handling, and managing application state.
