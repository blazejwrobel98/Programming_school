# Calculator

## Description
The aim of this project is to create a simple calculator in the C language, capable of performing basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Project Assumptions
- The program allows the user to enter two numbers.
- The user should be able to choose a mathematical operation.
- The program should display the result of the operation.
- The program should handle errors, such as division by zero.

## Functionality
1. **Data Entry**: The program should enable the user to enter two floating-point numbers.
2. **Operation Selection**: The user should be able to select the type of mathematical operation (e.g., '+', '-', '*', '/').
3. **Calculations**: Based on the selected data and operation, the program should perform the calculation and display the result.
4. **Error Handling**: The program should handle typical errors, such as division by zero, and inform the user of invalid input.

## Implementation Tips
- Use conditional statements to handle different mathematical operations.
- Remember to handle errors (e.g., division by zero).
- Consider using a loop to allow for multiple calculations without restarting the program.

## Educational Goal
This project aims to apply basic constructions of the C language, such as conditional statements, loops, and basic input/output operations, in a practical context.
