# Process Queue Simulator

## Description
The aim of this project is to create a process queue simulator in the C language. This simulator is designed to mimic the management of processes in an operating system, focusing on scheduling algorithms and queue management.

## Project Assumptions
- Simulation of various processes with different priorities and execution times.
- Implementation of scheduling algorithms such as FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) or SJF (Shortest Job First).
- Visualization of the process queue and the results of the scheduling algorithm.

## Functionality
1. **Creating Processes**: Simulating the creation of processes with different attributes (e.g., execution time, priority).
2. **Process Scheduling**: Implementing different scheduling algorithms for managing the process queue.
3. **Queue Visualization**: Displaying the state of the process queue and the operation of the scheduling algorithm in real-time.
4. **Results Analysis**: Evaluating the efficiency of different scheduling algorithms based on simulated data.

## Implementation Tips
- Use data structures, such as queues, for storing processes.
- Implement different scheduling algorithms and allow the user to choose which one to use.
- Consider adding an interactive user interface for monitoring and managing the simulation.

## Educational Goal
This project allows for a deeper understanding of process management in operating systems and the workings of scheduling algorithms. It is also an excellent opportunity to apply data structures and algorithms in the C language.
