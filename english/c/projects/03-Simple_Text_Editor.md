The aim of this project is to create a simple text editor in the C language, allowing for the creation, editing, and saving of text files.

## Project Assumptions
- The program allows the user to open, edit, and save text files.
- The user can input text, which is displayed in the console.
- The program offers basic editor functionalities, such as typing and deleting text.
